# **Introduction**
Food4you is a generic Web/Mobile application that will help the customers of any restaurant to place their orders without the waiter approaching them.

# **Why Food4You?**
Personally, I think everyone has encountered such a situation where they had to wait a very long time to place an order at a certain restaurant. I want to solve this problem, not for others but for me. If this application will help other users or restaurants, then even better.

# **Purpose and Benefits**
